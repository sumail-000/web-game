Milestone 1 – $50
Core setup: user accounts, studio accounts, authentication, permissions, and base structure for the platform.

Milestone 2 – $50
Group system: group creation, roles, renaming, group wall, group shout, group cover photo, and old Roblox-style group ads.

Milestone 3 – $50
Profile & social features: unlimited friends, best friends, online/last seen, best friends page, profile statuses, notifications, and username/display name changes.

Milestone 4 – $50
Avatar & pet UI (non-3D), creator dashboard tools, project management UI, map import placeholder, and all main pages/navigation (home, games list, catalog, create, notifications, settings, support chat).

Milestone 5 – $50
Marketplace (avatar shop, group store, alliances), safety tools (moderation, parental controls), polishing, final integration, and delivery.

I’ll use React with Next.js on the frontend, Node.js with Express  on the backend, Socket.IO for real-time chat and status updates, PostgreSQL for the database with Prisma ORM, JWT-based authentication, and cloud storage for images. This stack fits all required features and keeps everything scalable for the future 3D phase

also add premium and AdventureBux? to the platform

we need more safety features for younger users
make it so once you get terminated or banned you cant create a new account on the platform
